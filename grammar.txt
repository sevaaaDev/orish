all_commands     = [LINEBREAK], list, { LINEBREAK, list }, [LINEBREAK]

list             = simple_command, { ';', simple_command }, [';']

simple_command   = WORD, { WORD }


# notes
reserved word only recognized after linebreak/separator
thus in implementation, test for reserved word everytime you found linebreak/separator

this look like an LL(2) in semicolon & linebreak, but in implementation, you can make it LL(1) because those terminal will be consumed (if exist) later anyway, so you can ignore the second lookahead and eat the terminal rightaway
i actually dont know why this is LL(2). maybe if youre strict enough it is. but we just want it to work
the ebnf make implementation clearer. but it kinda hide some formal grammar stats
